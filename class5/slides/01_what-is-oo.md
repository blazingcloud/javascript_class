# What is an "object?" #

* In JavaScript, an object is a hash. That's it.
* In traditional object-oriented programming, an object is a data structure encapsulated with its *state* (properties, variables) and *behavior* (functions, methods, messages)
* Encapsulation groups similar things together, keeping dissimilar things apart

* A method can only access two sources of data directly: parameters of the method & properties of the method's own object
* All other data are manipulated via _messages_ (methods) to other objects
