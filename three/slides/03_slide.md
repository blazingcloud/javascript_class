# Closures #

* A closure is a function which is contained within another function
* Advantage: scope
* Lexical scope: Functions create their environment (scope) when they are defined (not when they're executed)
* NB: A function defined inside a function is invisible beyond the function, but a function defined inside a code block (<i>if</i> or <i>for</i> loops) IS visible outside the block
