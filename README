This is an experiment with the Blazing Cloud JavaScript for Programmers class, using showoff and markdown to create an accessible, version-controllable, geekable curriculum.

In order to view the slideshow, make sure you have the showoff gem installed, clone the repo locally, navigate to the folder of the slideshow you want to view ('one/' for example), and type 'showoff serve' into the command line. The default URL is http://localhost:9090

To download a pdf of the presentation, append '/pdf' to the URL of the slideshow.
